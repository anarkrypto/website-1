# Network & Transaction APIs

Each runtime method has access to the current execution context, which provides access to the following APIs: _network_ and _transaction_.
Both of these allow you to tap into information about the current transaction execution, such as the current block height or the transaction sender.

## Network API

The network API provides in-runtime method access to the observed network state. Following APIs are available under `this.network` within
a runtime method:
- Current block height
- Previous block's state root hash

```typescript {25-28, 34} showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
  runtimeMethod,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { StateMap, assert } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { MintProof } from './mint-proof'
import { PublicKey } from "o1js";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library"
 
interface BalancesConfig {
  totalSupply: UInt64;
}
 
@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<BalancesConfig> {
  @state() public balances = StateMap.from<PublicKey, UInt64>(
    PublicKey,
    UInt64
  );
 
  @runtimeMethod()
  public mint(address: PublicKey, amount: UInt64) {
    assert(
      UInt64.from(this.network.block.height).lessThanOrEqual(UInt64.from(1000)),
      "Minting ended at block height #1000"
    );
    this.balances.set(address, amount);
  }

  @runtimeMethod()
  public mintPrivate(proof: MintProof, amount: UInt64) {
    assert(this.network.previous.rootHash.equals(proof.publicOutput.rootHash), "Proof is not valid");
  }
}
```

## Transaction API

The transasction API offers access to the information about the transaction which invoked the current runtime method.
You can access the following information about the transaction:
- sender
- nonce
- methodId
- argsHash

> The _methodId_ and _argsHash_ are used by the _runtimeMethod_ decorator to prove that the runtime method execution was authorized by the transaction sender.

```typescript {21} showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
  runtimeMethod,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { assert, StateMap } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey } from "o1js";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library"

@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<Record<string, never>> {
  @state() public balances = StateMap.from<PublicKey, UInt64>(
    PublicKey,
    UInt64
  );

  @runtimeMethod()
  public mint(address: PublicKey, amount: UInt64) {
    assert(
      this.transaction.sender.value.equals(address),
      "Minting can only be done by the owner of the address"
    );
    this.balances.set(address, amount);
  }
}

```
