# State

Runtime modules are responsible for managing their own state. Runtime state is stored by the sequencer,
and accessible in a provable way within runtime modules.

## State path
From an app-chain perspective, there is only a single _state tree_ shared between all runtime modules.
This means we need a way to determine which state property belongs to which runtime module to avoid name collisions between modules.

We do this by using a _state path_, which consists of the _runtime module name_ and the _state property name_. In the case of a state map,
the state path is extended with the _state key_ used to access the value.

The single state tree model also means that runtime modules can access state from other modules (both read and write). As long as
they can reconstruct the module's state paths for each state property.

The state API, namely the decorators take care of generating the state paths for you, so you don't have to worry about it.

## Types of state

There are two types of state/storage available for runtime modules: _state_ and _state map_. State is a single value, while
state map is a mapping between two values (key-value). You can have an infinite number of state properties on a module,
and the state map can have a near indefinite number of key-value pairs. 

> Amount of available entries in the state map is a subject to size of the underlying state tree. By default 
> the state tree height is 256, allowing for 2^256 entries combined for the entire app-chain.

```typescript {16, 18} showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { State, StateMap } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey } from "o1js";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library";
 
interface BalancesConfig {
  totalSupply: UInt64;
}
 
@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<BalancesConfig> {
  @state() public balances = StateMap.from(PublicKey, UInt64);
 
  @state() public circulatingSupply = State.from(UInt64);
}
```

### Allowed state types

When it comes to determining which data types can be used as state, we have to consider
both _state values_ and in the case of a map, also _state keys_. In fact both of these
fall under the same constraints.

**✅ You can use the following data types as state values and keys:**
- UInt64, UInt32 (from `@proto-kit/library`)
- Field
- Signature
- PublicKey and other o1js primitives
- Structs _(⚠️ Need to be instantiated manually once retrieved from the state API)_

**❌ The following types are _not_ supported as storage values or keys:**
- Proof(s)

## Reading state

Accessing runtime state within a runtime module is done via the state API. State
is represented as an _optional_ value, since it may or may not exists at the time when its read.
This scenario can easily occur, if you're reading a state value before it has been set.

```typescript {16-20, 22-25} showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import { RuntimeModule, runtimeModule, state } from "@proto-kit/module";
import { Option, State, StateMap } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey } from "o1js";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library";

interface BalancesConfig {
  totalSupply: UInt64;
}

@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<BalancesConfig> {
  @state() public balances = StateMap.from(PublicKey, UInt64);

  @state() public circulatingSupply = State.from(UInt64);

  public getBalance(address: PublicKey): UInt64 {
    const balance = this.balances.get(address); // Option<UInt64>
    // Instantiate the UInt64 struct, only required if you're storing structs in the state
    return UInt64.from(balance.value);
  }

  public getCirculatingSupply(): UInt64 {
    const circulatingSupply = this.circulatingSupply.get();
    return UInt64.from(circulatingSupply.value);
  }
}
```

### Options and dummy values

State values are represented as options, which means there may or may not be a _real_ value underneath. We need options
in order to execute the runtime method in a provable way, even if there are no state values available. In such case the option
will carry a value substitute, known as a _dummy value_. 

> Imagine if we tried to execute the runtime method, but we wouldn't be able to provide a value for the retrieved state. Our circuit would
> behave in an unpredictable way or not work at all.

#### Some vs None

You can determine if the obtained state value exists, or if its a dummy by accessing the `.isSome` property on the option.

```typescript {18-20} showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { State, StateMap, Option } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey } from "o1js";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library";
 
interface BalancesConfig {
  totalSupply: UInt64;
}
 
@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<BalancesConfig> {
  @state() public balances = StateMap.from(PublicKey, UInt64);
 
  public hasBalance(address: PublicKey): Bool {
    return this.balances.get(address).isSome;
  }
}
```

#### Unwrapping options

Relying on the dummy value is not the best practice, therefore we offer a `.orElse(...)` method on the option, which
allows you to provide a fallback value in case the option is _none_.

```typescript {18-21} showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { State, StateMap, Option } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey } from "o1js";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library";
 
interface BalancesConfig {
  totalSupply: UInt64;
}
 
@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<BalancesConfig> {
  @state() public balances = StateMap.from(PublicKey, UInt64);

  public getBalance(address: PublicKey): UInt64 {
    const balance = this.balances.get(address).orElse(UInt64.from(0));
    return UInt64.from(balance.value);
  }
}
```

#### Structs

Structs have to be instantiated manually, since they are not automatically deserialized from the state API. This is due to
how o1js's `fromFields` API behaves - creating a "non-methods" version of the struct that just appears to match the struct structure,
but does not contain any of its instance methods.

> In certain cases consuming structs without re-instantiating them will work, but once you override the constructor of the struct you'll
> need to instantiate the struct by hand yourself.

Here's an example of how to use structs with the state API:

```typescript
class MyStruct extends Struct({}) {
  public hash() {
    return Poseidon.hash(MyStruct.toFields(this));
  }
}

class MyModule extends RuntimeModule<Record<never, never>> {
  @state() public myStruct = State.from(MyStruct);

  @runtimeMethod()
  public hashStruct() {
    const myStruct = new MyStruct(this.myStruct.get().value);
    Provable.log(myStruct.hash())
  }
}
```

## Writing state

Writing to the state is equally as easy as reading the state. Instead of `.get(...)` you can use
`.set(...)`. Setting a value of an already existing state key will overwrite the previous value.

> The set state API does not work with options, you can pass the actual values you want directly.


```typescript {19-21} showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { State, StateMap, Option } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey } from "o1js";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library";

 
interface BalancesConfig {
  totalSupply: UInt64;
}
 
@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<BalancesConfig> {
  @state() public balances = StateMap.from(PublicKey, UInt64);
 
  public setBalance(address: PublicKey, amount: UInt64) {
    this.balances.set(address, amount);
  }
}
```
