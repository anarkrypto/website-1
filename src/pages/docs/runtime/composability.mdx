# Composability

Runtime modules can be composed together in two primary ways: _inheritance_ and _interoperability_.
Through inheritance, you can extend the functionality of existing runtime modules with new features.
On the other hand, interoperability provides a way to create dependencies between separate runtime modules.

## Inheritance

Inheritance provides a simple mechanism for extending the functionality of existing runtime modules.
If you'd like to alter the behavior of a runtime module, you can extend it and override its methods.
You can even _soft disable_ certain methods if you'd like to prevent them from being called.

```typescript {30-33, 38-41} showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
  runtimeMethod,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { State, StateMap, Option, assert } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey, UInt64 } from "o1js";
 
interface BalancesConfig {
  totalSupply: UInt64;
}
 
@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<BalancesConfig> {
  @state() public balances = StateMap.from<PublicKey, UInt64>(
    PublicKey,
    UInt64
  );
 
  @runtimeMethod()
  public mint(amount: UInt64) {
    assert(this.transaction.nonce.equals(UInt64.from(0)), "Only new users can mint");
    this.balances.set(this.transaction.sender, amount);
  }
}

@runtimeModule()
export class CustomBalances extends Balances {
  @runtimeMethod()
  public override mint() {
    this.balances.set(this.transaction.sender, UInt64.from(1));
  }
}

@runtimeModule()
export class NoMintBalances extends Balances {
  @runtimeMethod()
  public override mint() {
    assert(Bool(false), "Minting is disabled");
  }
}
```

## Interoperability

Interoperability provides a way to create dependencies between separate runtime modules. Thanks to
constructor based _dependency injection_, you can inject one runtime module into another as a dependency. 
For this to work, both runtimes have to be a part of the same runtime.

In the example below we inject the _Balances_ runtime module into the _Vesting_ runtime module.
this allows us to mint tokens freely, since both modules are part of the same runtime.

<Callout type="warning">
This is a significant paradigm shift when compared to traditional smart contract development. Its up
to the developer to determine if multiple modules can safely co-exist within the same runtime. State and method
access is permissionless within the same runtime, so you should be careful when injecting dependencies.

```typescript {30-33, 38-41} showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
  runtimeMethod,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { State, StateMap, Option, assert } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey, UInt64 } from "o1js";
import { inject } from "tsyringe"
import { Balances } from "./balances";
 
@runtimeModule()
export class Vesting extends RuntimeModule<Record<string, never>> {
  public constructor(@inject("Balances") private balances: Balances) {}

  @runtimeMethod()
  public claim() {
    this.balances.mint(this.transaction.sender, UInt64.from(1000))
  }
}
```
