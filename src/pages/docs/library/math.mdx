# Math

Generally, all types that are usable in o1js are also usable out-of-the-box in protokit.
But there are some caveats to dealing with bounded integers (`UInt64`, `UInt32`).

### Integers

By default, o1js exposes two classes `UInt64` and `UInt32` to protect you from overflows that can happen
if you use `Field` directly.
Unfortunately, these don't work well with Protokit since they use the hard-failing o1js assertions instead of the protokit-specific `assert`.
This leads to your application being non-complete and being unable to include failed transactions in settlements.

To overcome this, we created a number of classes in `@proto-kit/library` that handle all of that for you while providing the same interface as the vanilla variants.

- `UInt32`
- `UInt64`
- `UInt112`
- `UInt224`

In addition to the o1js methods, we implement the `sqrtMod()` and `sqrtFloor()` functions to help facilitate square-root calculations.

### Precision

Since we don't have access to real numbers, only integers, doing things like division might get tricky sometimes.
That's why most other ecosystems have adapted precision based integers.

In our case, we use `UInt112` as the primary precision type, holding 112 bits of integer.
112 bits is reasonably efficient for Kimchi range-checks and has more than enough room for 18-decimal precision.

We have created helpers to facilitate working with precisions in your runtime code: `PrecisionUInt112` and `PrecisionUInt224`.

An example of how you can divide a `UInt112` number `x` by a another number `y` of the same type:

```typescript copy {4-6}
const precision = UInt112.from(10n ** 18n);

function divide(x: UInt112, y: UInt112): UInt112 {
  return PrecisionUInt112.fromUInt112(x)
    .mulPrecision(precision)
    .divPrecision(y)
}
```

Since `PrecisionUInt112` is a subclass of `UInt112`, we can use polymorphism when returning it.
