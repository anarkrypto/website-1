# Network State

Network state is a collection of data, that is accessible in runtime methods and onTransaction hooks.
It allows for runtime logic to access data about the current state of the underlying protocol and network.

Out of the box, this includes:
- Current block height
- Last block's state root
- ...

Generally, NetworkState fulfills the following properties.
- Stays the same throuh the whole execution of a block
- Can be altered through beforeBlock() and afterBlock() hooks


### Modifying network state

To modify, extend and transform the network state, see [Customizing the protocol](/docs/advanced/protocol)
