# Client interaction

Once you are ready to interact with your app-chain, the first step is to start the sequencer.
You may do so by using the Protokit CLI, which is available as part of the starter-kit under the 
following command:

```bash
pnpm dev --filter chain
```

The command above will start a local sequencer, which will be available at `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.

## Transaction API

Every app-chain exposes a transaction API, which is aware of the underlying runtime configuration.
This allows us to forge, sign and send transactions to the sequencer without having to worry about
the internal workings of the sequencer and its mempool.

> Keep in mind that our "client app-chain" is a localhost only app-chain, which means it is
configured to interact with the sequencer running on your local machine.

### Sending a transaction

Previously we've implemented a simple _CheckIn_ runtime module. Let's implement a simple client as
a test suite, that'll interact with our app-chain.

The code below does the following:
1. Generate a random signer keypair
2. Start the client _appChain_ and register a custom in-memory signer, which will be used to sign transactions
3. Resolve the _GuestBook_ runtime module, so we can interact with it
4. Create a transaction, which will call the _checkIn_ method of the _GuestBook_ runtime module
5. Sign and send the transaction to the locally hosted sequencer.


```typescript showLineNumbers {30-35} filename="packages/chain/test/interaction.test.ts"
import { InMemorySigner } from "@proto-kit/sdk";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library";
import { client as appChain } from "./../src/client.config";
import { PrivateKey } from "o1js";
import { GuestBook } from "../src/guest-book";

const signer = PrivateKey.random();
const sender = signer.toPublicKey();

describe("interaction", () => {
  let guestBook: GuestBook;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    await appChain.start();

    const inMemorySigner = new InMemorySigner();

    appChain.registerValue({
      Signer: inMemorySigner,
    });

    const resolvedInMemorySigner = appChain.resolve("Signer") as InMemorySigner;
    resolvedInMemorySigner.config = { signer };

    guestBook = appChain.runtime.resolve("GuestBook");
  });

  it("should interact with the app-chain", async () => {
    const rating = UInt64.from(3);
    const tx = await appChain.transaction(sender, () => {
      guestBook.checkIn(rating);
    });

    await tx.sign();
    await tx.send();
  });
});
```

You can run the test above with the following command:

```bash
pnpm test --filter=chain ./test/interaction.test.ts
```

## Query API

The query API allows you to fetch the latest state of the app-chain, using the underlying app-chain module configuration (e.g. available runtime modules).
Let's query for the latest check-in for a guest, from our GuestBook runtime module.

> The sequencer only stores the latest known app-chain state, it does not store any historical state.

Here's a breakdown of what happens in the test suite below:
1. Setup the client app-chain and configure a signer
2. Forge, sign and send a transaction using the transaction API
3. Wait for a couple seconds for a block to be produced
4. Query the latest check-in for the sender address, from the GraphQL API of the locally hosted sequencer.

```typescript showLineNumbers {38-40} filename="packages/chain/test/interaction.test.ts"
import { InMemorySigner } from "@proto-kit/sdk";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library";
import { client as appChain } from "./../src/client.config";
import { PrivateKey, Provable } from "o1js";
import { GuestBook } from "../src/guest-book";
import { sleep } from "@proto-kit/common";

const signer = PrivateKey.random();
const sender = signer.toPublicKey();

describe("interaction", () => {
  let guestBook: GuestBook;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    await appChain.start();

    const inMemorySigner = new InMemorySigner();

    appChain.registerValue({
      Signer: inMemorySigner,
    });

    const resolvedInMemorySigner = appChain.resolve("Signer") as InMemorySigner;
    resolvedInMemorySigner.config = { signer };

    guestBook = appChain.runtime.resolve("GuestBook");
  });

  it("should interact with the app-chain", async () => {
    const rating = UInt64.from(3);
    const tx = await appChain.transaction(sender, () => {
      guestBook.checkIn(rating);
    });

    await tx.sign();
    await tx.send();

    await sleep(8000);

    const checkIn = await appChain.query.runtime.GuestBook.checkIns.get(sender);
    Provable.log("checkIn", sender, checkIn);
  });
});
```

Don't forget to run your test suite again to see the results ðŸ‘†
