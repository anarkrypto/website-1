# App-chain's runtime

The starter-kit project contains an example application chain, that consists of a runtime created from a single runtime module called _Balances_.
This runtime module stores a ledger of balances for public keys, and the current circulating supply. 

It also defines a single runtime method called _addBalance_, which allows tokens to be minted for a certain address. It looks like this:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="packages/chain/src/balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
  runtimeMethod,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { State, StateMap, assert } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey, UInt64 } from "o1js";

interface BalancesConfig {
  totalSupply: UInt64;
}

@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<BalancesConfig> {
  @state() public balances = StateMap.from<PublicKey, UInt64>(
    PublicKey,
    UInt64
  );

  @state() public circulatingSupply = State.from<UInt64>(UInt64);

  @runtimeMethod()
  public addBalance(address: PublicKey, amount: UInt64): void {
    const circulatingSupply = this.circulatingSupply.get();
    const newCirculatingSupply = circulatingSupply.value.add(amount);
    assert(
      newCirculatingSupply.lessThanOrEqual(this.config.totalSupply),
      "Circulating supply would be higher than total supply"
    );
    this.circulatingSupply.set(newCirculatingSupply);
    const currentBalance = this.balances.get(address);
    const newBalance = currentBalance.value.add(amount);
    this.balances.set(address, newBalance);
  }
}
```

## Testing the runtime

In general it is considered a good practice to test your runtime modules in isolation. The starter kit
comes with a simple test suite that demonstrates how to do this. The test suite below does the following:

1. Setup a `TestingAppChain.fromRuntime`, providing only the _Balances_ module.
2. Provides non-mutable configuration for the _Balances_ module, including the _totalSupply_.
2. Starts the application chain, generates keypairs for testing and sets the transaction signer.
3. Forges a transaction to the `Balances` module, calling the `addBalance` method.
4. Signs and sends the transaction and produces a block for the application chain.
5. Queries the _Balances_ module for the balance of the test account (keypair generated earlier).
6. Asserts that the transaction was included in the block, while the execution of the transaction was successful.
7. Asserts that the balance of the test account has updated accordingly.

> The _TestingAppChain_ is a special type of application chain that is designed to be used in tests. It runs an in-memory version of the sequencer as well!

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="packages/chain/test/balances.test.ts"
import { TestingAppChain } from "@proto-kit/sdk";
import { PrivateKey, UInt64 } from "o1js";
import { Balances } from "../src/balances";

describe("balances", () => {
  it("should demonstrate how balances work", async () => {
    const appChain = TestingAppChain.fromRuntime({
      modules: {
        Balances,
      },
      config: {
        Balances: {
          totalSupply: UInt64.from(10000),
        },
      },
    });

    await appChain.start();

    const alicePrivateKey = PrivateKey.random();
    const alice = alicePrivateKey.toPublicKey();

    appChain.setSigner(alicePrivateKey);

    const balances = appChain.runtime.resolve("Balances");

    const tx1 = await appChain.transaction(alice, () => {
      balances.addBalance(alice, UInt64.from(1000));
    });

    await tx1.sign();
    await tx1.send();

    const block = await appChain.produceBlock();

    const balance = await appChain.query.runtime.Balances.balances.get(alice);

    expect(block?.txs[0].status).toBe(true);
    expect(balance?.toBigInt()).toBe(1000n);
  }, 1_000_000);
});
```

### Running the test(s)

The test above can be executed with the following command:

> Note: the `--watchAll` flag is optional, and will re-run the test suite when files change.

```bash
pnpm run test --filter=chain -- --watchAll
```
