# Implementing runtime modules

Its safe to assume that you'll want to implement your own runtime module, and add it to the application chain.
Doing so is very easy, and can be done in a few simple steps. We'll walk through the process of creating a simple
runtime module called _GuestBook_.

## Designing a runtime module

To design a runtime module, you'll need to consider the following:
1. What will be configurable in the module?
2. What data will the module store?
3. What methods will the module expose?

### Storage

For our _GuestBook_ module, we'll want to allow users to check-in in the guest book.
We'll start by defining the data model, namely the _CheckIn_ struct, which will determine what constitutes a check-in.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="packages/chain/src/guest-book/check-in.ts"
import { Field, PublicKey, Struct, UInt64 } from "o1js";

export class CheckInId extends Field {}
export class CheckIn extends Struct({
  guest: PublicKey,
  createdAt: UInt64,
  rating: UInt64,
}) {}
```

#### Define the runtime module

Second step is to create our runtime module and define the checkIns storage property, which will map a guest to the check-in they made.

```typescript showLineNumbers {11-14} filename="packages/chain/src/guest-book/index.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeMethod,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { StateMap, assert } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey, UInt64 } from "o1js";
import { CheckIn } from "./check-in";

@runtimeModule()
export class GuestBook extends RuntimeModule<Record<string, never>> {
  @state() public checkIns = StateMap.from(PublicKey, CheckIn);
}
```

### Methods

Now that we have our storage defined, we can start implementing the methods that will allow users to interact with the module.
We'll define the _checkIn__ method, which will allow users to check-in in the guest book.

> We're using the _transaction sender_ to identify and authorize check-ins.

```typescript showLineNumbers {15-27} filename="packages/chain/src/guest-book/index.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeMethod,
  runtimeModule,
  state,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { StateMap, assert } from "@proto-kit/protocol";
import { PublicKey, UInt64 } from "o1js";
import { CheckIn } from "./check-in";

@runtimeModule()
export class GuestBook extends RuntimeModule<Record<string, never>> {
  @state() public checkIns = StateMap.from(PublicKey, CheckIn);

  @runtimeMethod()
  public checkIn(rating: UInt64) {
    assert(rating.lessThanOrEqual(UInt64.from(5)), "Maximum rating can be 5");
    const guest = this.transaction.sender;
    const createdAt = this.network.block.height;
    const checkIn = new CheckIn({
      guest,
      createdAt,
      rating,
    });

    this.checkIns.set(checkIn.guest, checkIn);
  }
}
```

## Extending the app-chain configuration

In order to make use of the _GuestBook_ runtime module, we have to add it to the app-chain's runtime configuration.

```typescript showLineNumbers {8, 14} filename="packages/chain/src/runtime.ts"
import { UInt64 } from "o1js";
import { Balances } from "./balances";
import { GuestBook } from "./guest-book";

export default {
  modules: {
    Balances,
    GuestBook,
  },
  config: {
    Balances: {
      totalSupply: UInt64.from(10000),
    },
    GuestBook: {},
  },
};
```

**Congratulations! You've just implemented a custom runtime module ðŸŽ‰.** At this point, you would be
able to read its storage or send transactions to it from the client side app-chain (e.g. on the UI, or in tests).
