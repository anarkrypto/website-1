# Configuration

Your app-chain can be configured at three different levels: _runtime_, _chain_ and _client_. Firstly we start with the
overall runtime configuration, specifying the definition/configuration of your runtime module layout:

```typescript {5-7} showLineNumbers filename="packages/chain/src/runtime.ts"
import { UInt64 } from "o1js";
import { Balances } from "./balances";

export default {
  modules: {
    Balances,
  },
  config: {
    Balances: {
      totalSupply: UInt64.from(10000),
    },
  },
};
```

## Server & client configuration

The runtime configuration above is then used to define app-chain configurations for both client and server side app-chains.
Keep in mind that configuration for the rest of the app-chain, namely the protocol and the sequencer is provided implicitly behind the scenes.


> _chain.config.ts_ is used by Protokit's CLI to start a server-side app-chain, while _client.config.ts_ is used by the Protokit SDK to connect 
to the server-side app-chain via e.g. GraphQL.

```typescript {6} showLineNumbers filename="packages/chain/src/chain.config.ts"
import { LocalhostAppChain } from "@proto-kit/cli";
import runtime from "./runtime";

export default LocalhostAppChain.fromRuntime(runtime) as any; 
```

```typescript {6} showLineNumbers filename="packages/chain/src/client.config.ts"
import { ClientAppChain } from "@proto-kit/sdk";
import runtime from "./runtime";

export const client = ClientAppChain.fromRuntime(runtime);
```
