# User interface

The starter-kit comes pre-packaged with an example opinionated user interface. It consists of a simple
Next.js/React application, configured with:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for standardised styling
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as a component library
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) & [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) as middleware for state management
- Dependency on the `chain` package, which contains your application chain

## Wallet compatibility

The example user interface is compatible with the [Auro wallet](https://www.aurowallet.com/). This is possible thanks
to an app-chain level module called the _AuroSigner_, which delegates the responsibility of signing transactions to the auro wallet.

> Configuration of the _AuroSigner_ is done implicitly behind the scenes as part of the _ClientAppChain_ in _client.config.ts_.

If you'd like to use a different wallet, you'll have to implement a compatible signer module, following the _Signer_ interface:

```typescript showLineNumbers
export interface Signer extends AppChainModule<unknown> {
  sign: (signatureData: Field[]) => Promise<Signature>;
}
```

> In automated tests we use a special version of the signer known as the _InMemorySigner_, that does not require a browser wallet to be installed.

## Top-level await

O1JS uses top-level await, which does not play nicely with Next.js's app router due to the built-in server side rendering.
However there's a simple solution - loading our react components dynamically with _ssr_ disabled.

Top-level await incompatibility is the reason for splitting both _layout_ and _page_ into two files, one with a _-dynamic_ suffix and one without.

You can learn more about lazy loading react components [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading).

## Features

The example user interface comes with a few features out of the box, with the intention of showcasing various
interaction points between the UI and the app-chain. These features are:

- Managing the app-chain client
- Connecting the compatible browser wallet
- Polling for new blocks from the app-chain
- Fetching balances for the connected wallet, every time a new block is received
- Interacting with the app-chain's "faucet" (_Balances.addBalance_)
- Handling transaction notifications, by observing transaction statuses in the latest block.

### Architectural separation

All of the features above are implemented with a clear separation of concerns, by separating the code into three distinct layers:

- Data layer (Zustand stores, interaction with the app-chain, data fetching)
- Compositional layer (React containers, connecting the data layer to the presentational layer)
- Presentational layer (React components, responsible for how the data is displayed)

### App-chain client

Interacting with the locally hosted app-chain from the UI is done through the _ClientAppChain_, same as in the [client interaction](/docs/quickstart/client-interaction) documentation. Both the transaction API and the query API is available and preconfigured to work with your app-chain's 
runtime definition. 

> Keep in mind that the _ClientAppChain_ uses the GraphQL API of the locally hosted sequencer, so you'll have to
run both at the same time.

## Using a different UI framework

If you would like to use a different UI framework/stack than the one provided in the starter-kit, you totally can!
However there's quite a few things you have to keep in mind as far as configuration goes. The current UI setup
should give you enough information to switch to a different framework.
