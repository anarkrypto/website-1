# Runtime

In this section of the documentation we will cover the fundamental concepts behind runtime and runtime modules.
You can learn more about the runtime architecture in the [architecture docs](/docs/architecture/runtime)

### Designing runtime modules

Runtime modules are fundamentally different than smart-contracts, as in they are not _deployed_ individually, 
but rather composed into a single _Runtime_. This means that they don't have individual addresses as contracts do.

Therefore when designing e.g. the storage of a runtime module, you must consider the lifetime of the module and the data it stores.
With smart-contracts you could deploy a new contract for 'each user' - but you can't do that with a runtime module. Which means you
have to mitigate this by storing the data in a way that is shared between all users. The same applies to runtime methods as well.

## Defining a runtime module

First step towards building a runtime is to define a runtime module. Typical runtime module will consist of the following:
_configuration_, _storage_ and _methods_. Every runtime module must extend the `RuntimeModule` class, and be decorated
with the `@runtimeModule()` decorator.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
 
@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<Record<string, never>> {}
```

> `Record<string, never>` signifies an empty configuration object.

### Configuration

Configuration of the runtime module is immutable during execution. This means that any value you define as configuration,
will be made part of the underlying zero knowledge circuits as constants. Config is accessible as part of the
runtime module instance under `this.config.totalSupply`.

```typescript {7-9, 13-15} showLineNumbers  filename="balances.ts"
import {
  RuntimeModule,
  runtimeModule,
} from "@proto-kit/module";
import { UInt64 } from "@proto-kit/library";
 
interface BalancesConfig {
  totalSupply: UInt64;
}
 
@runtimeModule()
export class Balances extends RuntimeModule<BalancesConfig> {
  public getTotalSupply() {
    return this.config.totalSupply
  }
}
```
