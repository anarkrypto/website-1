# Quickstart

Prerequisites:

- Node.js v18
- pnpm
- nvm

### Setup

First, clone the starter-kit repository.

```sh copy
git clone https://github.com/proto-kit/starter-kit my-chain
cd my-chain
```

Then, make sure you have node `v18.*` installed by

```sh copy
nvm use 18.16.0
```

And to finish, install all dependencies

```sh copy
pnpm install
```

### Running the sequencer & UI

```sh
# starts both UI and sequencer locally
pnpm dev

# starts UI only
pnpm dev -- --filter web
# starts sequencer only
pnpm dev -- --filter chain
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the example UI, or to `localhost:8080/graphql` to see the GQL interface of the locally running sequencer.

### Running tests

```sh copy
# run and watch tests for the `chain` package
pnpm run test --filter=chain -- --watchAll
```
